# TransportApp

A web application that facilitates the transport of goods from external suppliers to Draexlmaier locations.

Current situation: in some locations, due to the high flow of material shipments, trucks have long waiting times. Queues also form at the entrance to the warehouses where unloading. 

What is desired: By using the created application, warehouse managers will be able to better manage the unloading of materials and prevent the formation of queues at the entrance to the warehouse.
